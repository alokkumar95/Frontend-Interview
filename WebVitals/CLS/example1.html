      When image dimensions are not specified, the browser renders your images
      using their original/full/natural size, and/or using CSS (applied to the
      image itself or its parent container). The problem here is the page space
      for the image can only be allocated once the image has been downloaded.
      The image itself will need some page space to be displayed when itâ€™s
      finished downloading. The end result is your page content constantly gets
      shifted about as the browser fetches and renders images.
